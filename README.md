## Welcome To My Theme Toggler ðŸ’»
This is a micro-project to demonstrate an understanding of CSS, Javascript, and HTML.  
### What does it do?
In this project, which can be viewed live over on my site [omarbrown.dev](https://omarbrown.dev/projects/themeswitcher/index.html), you may toggle between three different themes and the page will update accordingly.
